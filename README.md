In Numerical_Methods there are automated versions of 3 numerical methods used for approximating differential equations. 

To use these, you need to edit the code so that the differential (called the function f(x,y)) is the expression for the differential YOU want to estimate a solution for. 

For example, if my differential is dy/dx = 2xy^2, then I need to replace every place the function is called with 2 * x * y**2

For the sake of example, this function (2xy^2) has already been substituted for f(x,y).
